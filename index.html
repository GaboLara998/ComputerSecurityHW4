          <p class="text-justify">
            It is important to consider the point of view of two types of users
            for this app. First, the clients appear here as the most important,
            and then the drivers that work for the app.
          </p>
          <h5>Rides or Trips (Activity)</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Then, for the users, the app should have the next requirements at
            least:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Each cab in the zone, close to the client, should be available or
              shown in the map of the app, also the prices for a ride and
              arrival time (estimated).
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              Each user must have the availability to book a cab, and the type
              of a cab, with the available prices for each type.
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify">
              In the same way, users should have the availability to cancel a
              ride, during the time the cab is going to pick the client (If a
              cab arrived this option should not the able to apply when the
              client gets in the cab).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="paper-container">
          <h5>Device location (user’s case)</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">
            In that way, the device location is necessary. This is important
            because the point of having the location enabled helps the app to
            look for drivers close to the zone, and it could notify one of them
            that there is a client that needs a ride.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paper-container">
          <h5>S2 (id cells for location)</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">
            For this, there is the problem that longitude and latitude are not
            enough or not as good to determine a good potential to give the
            client a good experience. Then, there was an implementation done in
            Google, due to the spherical condition of the earth. S2 could be
            used here mainly to divide the map into cells, and each cell
            representing an area of the earth with an id.
          </p>
          <img
            src="resources/S2_implementation.jpg"

          <p class="text-justify">
            Then, the app also needs the id of a cell in a map, this is helpful
            to let the app know to the user, and also to a driver, for a client
            or driver close to it. Consider this, a client could enter the app,
            and the he/she could see for close drivers in the zone. The point
            for this is that the S2 library that could be applied here let the
            system look for a driver, the cell id and its location insider that
            cell.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The match or definition of close users is considered when in the
            system a N km circle is defined on a specific cell, and then the
            system takes to list of the cells ids that are inside the area of
            the circle. With a list of that, the location of a driver could be
            related with a cell, and if that is true it is shown in the screen
            of the app.
          </p>

            Although the client information could not be the main focus always
            for the good functionality, the input data of this that should be
            necessary for operate the app is the next one:

          <p class="text-justify">
            As it was mentioned before, the device location is necessary not
            just for the client, it is necessary for the driver also. Then the
            location helps more the operation of matching a client with a driver
            for a ride.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The point of this is that the driver could get a notification of
            clients close to him/her in the zone. The driver can accept or
            decline a request for a ride of a client, and the matching will be
            working then for both: client and driver.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            For this, it is necessary a system to make the matching process,
            like a dispatch system. This system will need the map routes and GPS
            data or device location data, so the client and driver devices
            should allow the app to access their location.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            For the drivers, the information should be divided in two parts:
            latitude and longitude, to set their positions on the map. In the
            same form it should occur for the clients, to help the driver to
            locate them and also to help the clients to look for drivers.

            The implementation of a driver service is applied first, to keep the
            location of the driver updated. Then, the idea is that the driver
            location is sent each time every n second, where n could iterate
            supposedly through the 3 to 9 minutes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Then, the data location is stored in a database, where it is
            updated, each time is possible. Consider that the last location of a
            cab is taken to put it in the screen and then to filter the drivers
            in a circle radius, defined for a client for close drivers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Then, when a driver is updated with location and a client in the
            same way, the system should assign each one in a region, or a
            defined area in a cell. When a region or space of a cell is inside
            an area, mainly the driver could get a ride for a client that made a
            request.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            For this, a web socket is needed, mainly to keep connection through
            the app with the client and the driver., and constantly get the
            location data updated. IN another hand, as the management of a high
            volume of information will be present, there should be a division
            between servers, mainly for different regions or cities, to
            distribute the matching and locations in different places to avoid
            time spent problems.

            considering each server or region (as a server implies a region or a

          <h5>PCI DSS</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set
            of security requirements that can help small merchants to protect
            customer card data located on payment cards. Since the customer uses
            a card payment for the service, and the driver provides savings
            account information, applying the guidelines and principles
            specified by this standard will decrease the likelihood of a
            potential data breach. Not only that, taking into account the
            sensitivity of this information, PCI DSS will help us avoid
            financial losses, legal problems and stain to our reputation.

            These are some guidelines and requirements PCI DSS exposes to create
            a safer payment system:

          <p class="text-justify">
            <strong>Understand your payment system.</strong> The application's
            payment page is the form used to collect our customer’s payment card
            data after they have decided to purchase the drive-sharing service.
            Handling of card data may be 1) managed exclusively by the merchant
            using a shopping cart or payment application, 2) partially managed
            by the merchant with the support of a third party using a variety of
            methods, or 3) wholly outsourced to a third party. Most times, using
            a wholly outsourced third party is the safest option; and it is
            important to make sure they are a PCI DSS validated third party.

            <li>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Use strong passwords and change default ones. (a) Is suggested
                to change passwords every three months. (b) The most common
                passwords are “password” and “123456.”

              <p class="text-justify">
                Protect card data and only store what you need. (a) The best way
                to protect against data breaches is not to store card data at
                all. Consider outsourcing your card processing to a PCI DSS
                compliant service provider. (b) Securely destroy/shred card data
                you don’t need. (c) Rather than accepting payment details via
                email, ask customers to provide it via phone, fax, or regular

                Install patches from your vendors. (a) You may get patches from
                vendors of your payment terminal, payment applications, other
                payment systems (tills, cash registers, PCs, etc.), operating
                systems (Android, Windows, iOS, etc.), application software

                etc. so they can support the latest security patches. (b)
                Installing patches as soon as possible is very important.
                Software can have flaws that are discovered after release,
                caused by mistakes made by programmers when they wrote the code.
                These flaws are also called security holes, bugs or
                vulnerabilities. Hackers exploit these mistakes to break into
                your computer and steal account data. Protect your systems by
                applying vendor-supplied “patches” to fix coding errors. Timely

                up-to-date anti-virus (also called anti malware) software helps
                to protect your systems. (b) Schedule regular full system scans,
                since your systems may have been infected by new malware that
                was released before your anti-virus software was able to detect

                Make data useless to criminals. (a) Data is vulnerable when it
                travels through internet, and when it’s kept or stored on your
                computers and devices. The best way to keep it safe is to make
                it useless even if it’s stolen by encrypting it whenever you
                store it or send it, and removing it altogether when it’s not
                needed. (b) You should encrypt all card data you store or send.
                Make sure your payment system is using encryption and/or
                tokenization technology. If you are not sure, ask them.

                main highway used by data thieves to attack and steal your
                customers’ card data. For this reason, if your business is on
                the Internet, anything you use for card payments needs extra
                protection. A firewall is equipment or software that sits
                between your payment system and the Internet. It acts as a
                barrier to keep traffic out of your network and systems that you
                don’t want and didn’t authorize. Firewalls are configured (in
                hardware, software, or both) with specific criteria to block or
                prevent unauthorized access to a network. A properly configured
                firewall acts as a buffer to keep hackers and malicious software
                from getting access to your payment systems, your e-commerce
                website, and/or your card data. Check with your payment terminal
                vendor or service provider to make sure you have one and ask
                them for help configuring it correctly.
