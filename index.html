              It is important to consider the point of view of two types of
              users for this app. First, the clients appear here as the most
              important, and then the drivers that work for the app.
            </p>
            <h5>Rides or Trips (Activity)</h5>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Then, for the users, the app should have the next requirements at
              least:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text-justify">
                Each cab in the zone, close to the client, should be available
                or shown in the map of the app, also the prices for a ride and
                arrival time (estimated).
              </li>
              <li class="text-justify">
                Each user must have the availability to book a cab, and the type
                of a cab, with the available prices for each type.
              </li>
              <li class="text-justify">
                In the same way, users should have the availability to cancel a
                ride, during the time the cab is going to pick the client (If a
                cab arrived this option should not the able to apply when the
                client gets in the cab).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="paper-container">
            <h5>Device location (user’s case)</h5>
            <p class="text-justify">
              In that way, the device location is necessary. This is important
              because the point of having the location enabled helps the app to
              look for drivers close to the zone, and it could notify one of
              them that there is a client that needs a ride.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="paper-container">
            <h5>S2 (id cells for location)</h5>
            <p class="text-justify">
              For this, there is the problem that longitude and latitude are not
              enough or not as good to determine a good potential to give the
              client a good experience. Then, there was an implementation done
              in Google, due to the spherical condition of the earth. S2 could
              be used here mainly to divide the map into cells, and each cell
              representing an area of the earth with an id.
            </p>
            <img
              src="resources/S2_implementation.jpg"

            <p class="text-justify">
              Then, the app also needs the id of a cell in a map, this is
              helpful to let the app know to the user, and also to a driver, for
              a client or driver close to it. Consider this, a client could
              enter the app, and the he/she could see for close drivers in the
              zone. The point for this is that the S2 library that could be
              applied here let the system look for a driver, the cell id and its
              location insider that cell.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              The match or definition of close users is considered when in the
              system a N km circle is defined on a specific cell, and then the
              system takes to list of the cells ids that are inside the area of
              the circle. With a list of that, the location of a driver could be
              related with a cell, and if that is true it is shown in the screen
              of the app.
            </p>

              for the good functionality, the input data of this that should be

            <p class="text-justify">
              The driver information should be the most important here, because
              the driver is the person with more exposed information to operate
              the app. In that way, the driver is responsible to give the next
              data:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text-justify">
                Personal data, like the name, cell phone, mail, personal photo,
                bank account. This is essential for its payment for doing the
                job, but also to show the driver aspects to the client.

              <li class="text-justify">
                Rides done, although this is applied by the system to the

              <li class="text-justify">
                Vehicle credentials. For the vehicle credentials, the vehicle
                registration, the vehicle model, the vehicle color and visual
                aspects. This is necessary to avoid any kind of assaults or
                stealing for the client, considering the possibility of an
                impostor or a driver that tried to alter the ride process.
              </li>
              <li class="text-justify">
                Driver location, in order to know where is he/she located in the

                between them and how close could be the driver to the client.

            <h5>Matchmaking management</h5>

            <p class="text-justify">
              As it was mentioned before, the device location is necessary not
              just for the client, it is necessary for the driver also. Then the
              location helps more the operation of matching a client with a
              driver for a ride.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              The point of this is that the driver could get a notification of
              clients close to him/her in the zone. The driver can accept or
              decline a request for a ride of a client, and the matching will be
              working then for both: client and driver.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              For this, it is necessary a system to make the matching process,
              like a dispatch system. This system will need the map routes and
              GPS data or device location data, so the client and driver devices
              should allow the app to access their location.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              For the drivers, the information should be divided in two parts:
              latitude and longitude, to set their positions on the map. In the
              same form it should occur for the clients, to help the driver to
              locate them and also to help the clients to look for drivers.

            <h5>Dispatch system functionality</h5>
            <p class="text-justify">
              The implementation of a driver service is applied first, to keep
              the location of the driver updated. Then, the idea is that the
              driver location is sent each time every n second, where n could
              iterate supposedly through the 3 to 9 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Then, the data location is stored in a database, where it is
              updated, each time is possible. Consider that the last location of
              a cab is taken to put it in the screen and then to filter the
              drivers in a circle radius, defined for a client for close
              drivers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Then, when a driver is updated with location and a client in the
              same way, the system should assign each one in a region, or a
              defined area in a cell. When a region or space of a cell is inside
              an area, mainly the driver could get a ride for a client that made
              a request.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              For this, a web socket is needed, mainly to keep connection
              through the app with the client and the driver., and constantly
              get the location data updated. IN another hand, as the management
              of a high volume of information will be present, there should be a
              division between servers, mainly for different regions or cities,
              to distribute the matching and locations in different places to
              avoid time spent problems.

              A gossip protocol is needed then, to communicate servers between
              them and let each one of them know the other’s information. This
              could be helpful to reduce or increase the number of servers.
              Then, considering each server or region (as a server implies a
              region or a group of cells in a map), a driver or client could
              find the other connecting through servers in the dispatch system.

              another server where the other cells are saved. In that case, if
              there is a driver in one of those cells, the driver gets the

              When the estimated time is applied for a driver when it accepts to

              Some of them could be the climate condition, traffic in the zone,
              transit signals, and some others. However, when a driver goes
              through the streets of a city, he/she can act effectively on

              Privacy by Design(PbD) is a data privacy concept that calls for
              the incorporation of data privacy protections into the design of
              information systems , products, and services. The goal of PbD is
              to prevent data privacy breaches and protect the privacy of
              individuals by proactively incorporating data privacy safeguards
              into systems and processes. To achieve this we can rely in
              cybersecurity frameworks, which are a set of practices and
              guidelines an organization implements to safeguard its data and
              manage cybersecurity risk. The NIST Privacy Framework (NPF) is a
              voluntary tool developed in collaboration with stakeholders
              intended to help organizations identify and manage privacy risk to
              build innovative products and services while protecting
              individual's privacy.

                  Install patches from your vendors. (a) You may get patches
                  from vendors of your payment terminal, payment applications,
                  other payment systems (tills, cash registers, PCs, etc.),
                  operating systems (Android, Windows, iOS, etc.), application
                  software (including your web browser), and business software.
                  Make sure your vendors update your payment terminals,
                  operating systems, etc. so they can support the latest
                  security patches. (b) Installing patches as soon as possible
                  is very important. Software can have flaws that are discovered
                  after release, caused by mistakes made by programmers when
                  they wrote the code. These flaws are also called security
                  holes, bugs or vulnerabilities. Hackers exploit these mistakes
                  to break into your computer and steal account data. Protect
                  your systems by applying vendor-supplied “patches” to fix
                  coding errors. Timely installation of security patches is
                  crucial.

                  mistakes, so they can break into your systems and steal card
                  data. Using up-to-date anti-virus (also called anti malware)
                  software helps to protect your systems. (b) Schedule regular
                  full system scans, since your systems may have been infected
                  by new malware that was released before your anti-virus

                  Make data useless to criminals. (a) Data is vulnerable when it
                  travels through internet, and when it’s kept or stored on your
                  computers and devices. The best way to keep it safe is to make
                  it useless even if it’s stolen by encrypting it whenever you
                  store it or send it, and removing it altogether when it’s not
                  needed. (b) You should encrypt all card data you store or
                  send. Make sure your payment system is using encryption and/or
                  tokenization technology. If you are not sure, ask them.

                  the main highway used by data thieves to attack and steal your
                  customers’ card data. For this reason, if your business is on
                  the Internet, anything you use for card payments needs extra
                  protection. A firewall is equipment or software that sits
                  between your payment system and the Internet. It acts as a
                  barrier to keep traffic out of your network and systems that
                  you don’t want and didn’t authorize. Firewalls are configured
                  (in hardware, software, or both) with specific criteria to
                  block or prevent unauthorized access to a network. A properly
                  configured firewall acts as a buffer to keep hackers and
                  malicious software from getting access to your payment
                  systems, your e-commerce website, and/or your card data. Check
                  with your payment terminal vendor or service provider to make
                  sure you have one and ask them for help configuring it
                  correctly.

              The following analysis is based on a new data protection law
              proposed by the Ecuadorian government in 2021, in which specifies
              mandatory policies for any company that handles personal data,
              setting a significant precedent in the country's approach to data
              privacy and security . These regulations align with global trends
              in data protection, reflecting a growing awareness of the
              importance of safeguarding personal information in the digital
