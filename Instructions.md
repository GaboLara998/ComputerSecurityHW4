## Homework 4

### Information Security


### Instructions:

For this homework, you will work in groups of 5 people. You are expected to include with your submission the following details:

1. A URL to the GitHub page containing your group's assignment
2. Each member of the team will submit a grade (0 to 100) for the team members based on the amount of work that each member contributed


### 1. Design the system components of a drive sharing application (ex: Uber, Lyft). Specify what elements are necessary for this application to work. 

- Your design must include a block diagram of each of the components to have the application needs to operate.
- In your design, you must provide a list of the data that you need to collect for the operation of the application. For each, provide a description of why you need this data. Examples:
    - who are the users of your application? what kind of information do you need of each of them?
    - what data do you need to make the user experience better? Examples: better ride experience, shorter wait time, faster routes, etc
    - what kind of data do you need to collect to measure the performance and efficiency of the application? 
    - what about payment and tipping?

- Include a privacy design for the application. 
    - For all the data that is being collected, what can be seen and by whom? 
    - What information should have restricted access? 
    - what information should not be seen by anyone?
    
- Assume you are a pen-tester and you are in charge of testing the privacy design proposed.
    - What are the risks if you are able to get access to the app as a user, as an admin, and as developer?
    - In any of these cases, what are the ways that an attacker can provoke a privacy breach? What kind of attacks can be used to accomplish this.
    - Write an ethical analysis of the consequences of a privacy breach of the app for each of the cases above. 


### 2. Your drive sharing company has decided to sell users data to advertisers. 

- You have been asked to loosen up your design so that data can be sold to advertisers. Additionally, your manager has asked you to provide a list of data that can be sold, so the advertisers can maximize the accuracy of the ads. 
- Provide the details of the new privacy design following the same principles you used for the original design.
- Repeat the pen-tester exercise done for the original design.
